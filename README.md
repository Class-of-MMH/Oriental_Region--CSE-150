# Vehicle Parking Management System




## Project Overview

The **Vehicle Parking Management System** is a console-based application developed in C for managing parking spaces. The system allows users to record and manage parking details for various vehicle types, calculate parking fees based on time, and view overall parking statistics.


## Features

1. **Date Logging:**

Users start by entering the date to initiate the parking log for the day.

2. **Vehicle Types:**

The system supports various vehicle types, including buses, trucks, private cars, motorcycles, and bicycles.

3. **Time-based Billing:**

Users input the time a vehicle enters the parking lot, and the system calculates parking fees based on predefined rates.

4. **Billing Categories:**

Different billing rates are applied to each vehicle type (e.g., buses, trucks, private cars) to accommodate varying sizes and parking requirements.

5. **Total Billing:**

The system provides a total billing amount for all parked vehicles at the end of the session.

6. **User-Friendly Interface:**

The console interface is designed to be simple and easy to navigate, with clear prompts and instructions.
## Usage

1. **Getting Started:**

Run the executable file after compiling the source code.
Enter the date to start recording parking details.

2. **Adding Vehicles:**

Users can add vehicles by selecting the appropriate option and entering details such as time and registration number.

3. **Viewing Parking Details:**

Users can view the current parking details, including the types of vehicles parked, their respective times, and billing information.

4. **Exiting the System:**

The system allows users to exit, providing a total billing summary for the day.
## Code Structure

The source code is organized into functions for displaying vehicle images, parking details, and the main menu. The main function handles user input and executes corresponding actions based on the selected option.
## Future Enhancements

The "Vehicle Parking Management System" can be further improved with the following enhancements:

1. **User Authentication:**

Implement user authentication to control access to the system.

2. **Database Integration:**

Replace file-based storage with a database for better data management and retrieval.

3. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**

Develop a graphical user interface for a more visually appealing and user-friendly experience.

4. **Real-time Updates:**

Include real-time updates for parking availability and fees.
## Conclusion

The **Vehicle Parking Management System** provides a functional and efficient solution for managing parking spaces. It serves as a foundation that can be expanded upon to meet the evolving needs of users and parking management scenarios.
